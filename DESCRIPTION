Description: Implements Bayesian dynamic factor analysis with 'Stan'. Dynamic 
    factor analysis is a dimension reduction tool for multivariate time series.
    'bayesdfa' extends conventional dynamic factor models in several ways. 
    First, extreme events may be estimated in the latent trend by modeling
    process error with a student-t distribution. Second, autoregressive and 
    moving average components can be optionally included. Third, the estimated
    dynamic factors can be analyzed with hidden Markov models to evaluate
    support for latent regimes.
